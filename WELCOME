Welcome to SkilStak!

This home directory is yours. You can customize it however you wish so long
as what you change does not hurt other users experiences here. This server
is just for coding and previewing what you have coded. Your Minecraft and other
servers are elsewhere.

By default your home directory is private so that others cannot see inside it.

Once you learn enough about Linux and the command-line you will be able to
remove this README file.
